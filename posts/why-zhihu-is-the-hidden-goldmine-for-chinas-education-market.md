Behind this scenario are some eye-opening figures:

## 🥊 Platform Showdown: Zhihu's Competitive Advantage

We compared the effectiveness of three popular platforms for educational marketing:

| Dimension          | Zhihu                        | WeChat            | Douyin (TikTok)    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Content Depth      | ★★★★★ (5000+ words articles) | ★★★ (short posts) | ★★ (15-sec videos) |
| Trust Factor       | Verified experts + badges    | Personal networks | Influencer-driven  |
| Decision Influence | 78% (survey data)            | 43%               | 29%                |
