# Why New Zealand SMEs Need to Prioritise Digital Marketing in China in 2025

Did you know every dollar spent marketing in China can return significantly more than investing in local markets?

For New Zealand SMEs, 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most challenging years yet. AI-driven technologies are reshaping global business landscapes, the local job market is tightening, and economic conditions are tougher than ever. But amid these difficulties, one golden opportunity stands out—the enormous potential of the Chinese market.

As a digital marketing specialist here in New Zealand, I've spent several years studying how Kiwi businesses are succeeding (and sometimes struggling) with digital marketing in China. What I’ve found is clear: **businesses that focus their digital marketing efforts on China are thriving—even in tough times.**

### The Enormous Potential of China’s Market

To grasp why China matters so much for New Zealand businesses, let's take a quick look at some compelling figures:

| Metric                   | New Zealand Market | Chinese Market      |
|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Consumer population      | 5.1 million        | Around 820 million  |
| Internet penetration     | 93%                | 74% (and rising)    |
| Annual e-commerce sales  | NZ$4.7 billion     | NZ$2.4 trillion     |

Put simply, the Chinese market is over 160 times the size of ours. Plus, Chinese consumers are highly digital-savvy, accustomed to discovering and buying products via platforms like WeChat, Douyin (TikTok), and Little Red Book.

### The Kiwi Advantage: Trusted by Chinese Consumers

New Zealand products have already established a powerful reputation in China, valued for quality, safety, and purity. This national brand advantage is something uniquely beneficial for Kiwi businesses. For instance:

- The **New Zealand Pavilion on Tmall** has demonstrated the power of collective marketing, significantly boosting sales during special promotions.
- **Ecostore**, with carefully tailored local marketing, won the prestigious "Emerging Mother and Baby Brand" award at the 2024 Tmall Global Merchants Conference.

These successes confirm that our brand carries substantial weight with Chinese consumers.

### Digital Marketing Expertise: The Critical Factor

Despite successes, many Kiwi businesses still make crucial mistakes. Too often, they copy-and-paste Western marketing strategies without fully understanding China's unique digital landscape.

**Why hire digital marketing experts?**

- China isn't a single market; it's diverse with substantial regional differences.
- Unique marketing approaches, like livestream commerce, short videos, and influencer (KOL) partnerships, vastly outperform traditional advertising.
- Only professionals who deeply understand Chinese culture, consumer behaviours, and local digital platforms can create effective marketing strategies.

### Why Now Is the Perfect Time

The upgraded New Zealand-China Free Trade Agreement has removed tariffs on over 98% of our exports, creating an ideal environment for digital commerce. Additionally, AI-driven technologies have significantly reduced the cost of digital marketing, making it accessible even for SMEs.

However, the key to capitalising on this opportunity is to act quickly.

### Practical Tips for Kiwi SMEs

- **WeChat Marketing**: Set up an official service account, utilise WeChat Pay and Mini Programs, and partner with local influencers and community groups.
- **Douyin Marketing**: Create engaging short videos, leverage livestream shopping, and initiate branded hashtag challenges.
- **Little Red Book Marketing**: Promote authentic user-generated content (UGC), partner with key opinion consumers (KOCs), and build genuine consumer trust.

### The Future Belongs to Those Who Act Now

Yes, 2025 will be challenging, but challenges bring opportunities. For New Zealand SMEs, this is a pivotal moment to adapt and invest in digital marketing focused on China. It could be the key to not only surviving but thriving.

**Remember, businesses that innovate during times of crisis are usually the biggest winners.**
